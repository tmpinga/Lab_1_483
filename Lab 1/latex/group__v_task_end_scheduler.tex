Stops the real time kernel tick. All created tasks will be automatically deleted and multitasking (either preemptive or cooperative) will stop. Execution then resumes from the point where v\-Task\-Start\-Scheduler () was called, as if v\-Task\-Start\-Scheduler () had just returned.

See the demo application file main. c in the demo/\-P\-C directory for an example that uses v\-Task\-End\-Scheduler ().

v\-Task\-End\-Scheduler () requires an exit function to be defined within the portable layer (see v\-Port\-End\-Scheduler () in port. c for the P\-C port). This performs hardware specific operations such as stopping the kernel tick.

v\-Task\-End\-Scheduler () will cause all of the resources allocated by the kernel to be freed -\/ but will not free resources allocated by application tasks.

Example usage\-: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
 void vTaskCode( void * pvParameters )
 \{
     for( ;; )
     \{
Task code goes here.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}At some point we want to end the real time kernel processing
so call ...
         vTaskEndScheduler ();
     \}
 \}\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre} void vAFunction( void )
 \{
Create at least one task before starting the kernel.
     xTaskCreate( vTaskCode, "NAME", STACK\_SIZE, NULL, tskIDLE\_PRIORITY, NULL );\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Start the real time kernel with preemption.
     vTaskStartScheduler ();\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Will only get here when the vTaskCode () task has called
vTaskEndScheduler ().  When we get here we are back to single task
execution.
